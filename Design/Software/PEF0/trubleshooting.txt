trubleshooting in case you have to install everything da capo

usual problems: 

don't trust the pip3 -r install requirements.txt, it doesn't work. It's trublesome but go on installing each dependency one by one

Install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake

Numpy doesn't work. You have to install this library by doing 
- sudo apt install libatlas3-base

Scipi has to be installed from apt
-sudo apt install -y python3-scipy

rawpy has to be installed from source by making:

-sudo apt-get install libraw-dev
-git clone https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw.git libraw
-git clone https://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw-cmake.git libraw-cmake
-cd libraw
-git checkout 0.20.0
-cp -R ../libraw-cmake/* .
-cmake .
-sudo make install
-git clone https://github.com/letmaik/rawpy
-cd rawpy
-pip install numpy cython
-pip install .
